title: About
---

I am a first year doctoral student in the School of Informatics and Computing at [Indiana University](https://cs.indiana.edu) and occasionally an artist
in paper, wood, metal, leather, and stone.  
\\
My research is primarily into the application of formal logic and type theories to programming languages.  
\\
I find joy in the elegance of mathematics and art alike. In fact, I find work in both to involve the same creative, constructive processes.
